## Introduction

The ACES Inventory and Fund Management System aims to digitalize and streamline inventory and fund request processes for ACES. By replacing the outdated paper-based system, it provides a user-friendly digital platform that improves real-time tracking, reduces manual errors, and enhances productivity.

Designed for administrators, inventory managers, and students, the system enables efficient management of stocks, funding requests, and approvals. Key features include real-time updates, automated notifications, secure record-keeping, and data-driven insights for better decision-making.
